# Customer-Feedback-Portal
# Project Description
The Customer Feedback Portal is a basic web application that allows users to submit their feedback, including their name, a rating (from 1 to 5), and comments. The submitted feedback is then displayed on the same page. This project demonstrates basic web development concepts, including HTML for structure, CSS for styling (if you choose to add it), and JavaScript for interactivity.

## Features
Form for users to submit their feedback with the following fields:
- Name (text input)
- Rating (dropdown selection)
- Comments (textarea)
- Display area for showing the submitted feedback
- Form validation to ensure all fields are filled out before submission
- Dynamic feedback display without reloading the page
